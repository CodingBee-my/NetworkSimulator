{"name":"Educational Network Simulator","tagline":"Educational Network Simulator Project","body":"### Welcome to my Educational Network Simulator\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide secondary schools with a simulator in which students can practice and understand, among others, the following concepts:\r\n* Basic networking components: hosts (clients and servers), routers and switches\r\n* IP addresses and subnet masks\r\n* Gateways\r\n* Unicasting / Broadcasting\r\n* Concept of protocol\r\n* Basic networking commands: ping, traceroute\r\n* Static / dynamic IP addresses / DHCP\r\n* \"Gateway mode\" vs \"Router mode\" in routers\r\n* NAT\r\n* Servers: DNS, HTTP, DHCP\r\n\r\n### Is this a realistic network simulator?\r\nNo. If you are looking for a simulator that implements real protocols, real message structures, etc., this is not for you, sorry.\r\n\r\nThis is a simplification aimed to allow secondary school teachers to explain the basic concepts above. That does not mean that real situations cannot be simulated, but not to a TCP segment or IP datagram granularity.\r\n\r\nAlso, the implemented protocols are only simplifications with educational purposes (i.e., to know what a protocol is).\r\n\r\nIf your are still interested in it, have a try!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
